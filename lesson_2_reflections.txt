1. When you initialize a repository a .git directory
is created in the parent directory. You need to do this
because this allows the files in the repository to be 
tracked together to keep the project together.

2. The staging area is different from the working directory
in that files from the working directory are added to the 
staging area.  It is different from the repository in that
files that are added to the staging area are bundled into 
one commit. This allows the user to only add the files 
they want from the working directory to the commit in the
repository.

3. You can use the staging area to only add files that you
changed to the commit, making sure that it is one commit
per logical change
