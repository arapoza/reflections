1. When you initialize a repository a .git directory
is created in the parent directory. You need to do this
because this allows the files in the repository to be 
tracked together to keep the project together.

2. The staging area is different from the working directory
in that files from the working directory are added to the 
staging area.  It is different from the repository in that
files that are added to the staging area are bundled into 
one commit. This allows the user to only add the files 
they want from the working directory to the commit in the
repository.

3. You can use the staging area to only add files that you
changed to the commit, making sure that it is one commit
per logical change.

4. In our GNOME Music Player project if we try to fix a bug
or add a new feature but we didn't want to risk breaking 
the previous version of the code we could create our own 
branch to fix the bug on.

5. Diagrams help by showing where different commits lie
on the branch and what the relationship between different 
commits is. They also clearly show the concept of 
reachability which is helpful when visualized. 

6. When you merge two branches together all the commits in 
both branches get a common parent commit. This makes the 
commits of both branches reachable from that parent commit.
We represent it in the diagram the way we do because it shows
us how the two branches are connected by a common commit.
