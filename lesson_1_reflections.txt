1. By viewing the output of the diff command between 
the two different files I was able to notice
that a line that had been added had a typo 
for "space" and so it wasn't working properly.
I was able to see that this was what was causing
the bug to happen.

2. Being able to easily access the entire history of 
a file would make it much easier to spot the 
differences between the two that could lead to bugs
and then fix the bugs, rather than combing through
the entire new problem looking for one small typo.

3. If you manually choose when to create a commit,
you can ensure that the version you're creating
actually works and won't end at an abrupt or incorrect
ending. You can make sure that the versions actually
make sense.

4. Because with coding, projects will often have 
interrelated files that depend on one another and 
thus need to be saved and tracked together. However,
it is highly unlikely that two Google Docs will be
related enough to require them to be saved together.

5. Using git log I can tell what overall changes I 
made and when I made them and using git diff I can 
tell what exactly I changed in the code between the 
commits.

6. Because I can always be confident that I can go back
and checkout versions of the code I already had and 
restore them so I don't break anything.

7. Kofi and I were looking at working on the GNOME Project
and in particular their Music app so using git and github
will be essential in managing the versions of the app that
are already created and the different versions that we will
hopefully end up creating.
