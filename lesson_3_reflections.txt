1. You would want to use a remote repository when you
are working with other people. If everything is local
your collaborators won't be able to see your changes 
and you won't be able to see theirs so it is best to 
work from a remote repository.

2. You might want to always pull changes automatically
rather than automatically for the same reason you commit
manually. You might have made a change on either the remote
or the local directory that you don't want to be present
on the other, so you have to wait to mannually push or pull.

3. A clone is a copy of a repository made either from GitHub
to a local machine or on a local machine. A fork is a copy
of a repository that is hosted on GitHub and can be cloned
onto a user's computer. A branch is a different set of commits
that are in the repo.

4. With the copy of the last known state of the remote stored 
locally it makes it much easier to resolve and merge conflicts
when there are changes both to the remote and the local directory.
